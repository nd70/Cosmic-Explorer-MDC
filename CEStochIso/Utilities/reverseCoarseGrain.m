%  reverseCoarseGrain --- fine-grain a frequency-series
%
%  reverseCoarseGrain(y, flowx, deltaFx, Nx, inferNegFreqs) returns a 
%  fine-grained frequency-series structure from the coarse-grained 
%  frequency-series y.  inferNegFreqs is a flag which determines whether 
%  negative frequencies are also set to make the Fourier transform of a 
%  real time series.
%
%  reverseCoarseGrain also returns the indices of the lowest and highest 
%  frequency bins of x that overlap with y (0 <= index1 <= length(x);
%  1 <= index2 <= length(x)+1) and the fractional contributions from these
%  frequency bins.
